# SolarCleaningSystem

Overview
An automated system designed to optimize solar panel efficiency by cleaning the panels only when necessary. The system intelligently checks solar output levels and water availability before activating a water pump to spray the panels, conserving both energy and water.

Key Features
Monitors solar panel output voltage
Checks if water tank has sufficient water
Only activates cleaning when output is low and water is available
Uses Arduino Nano, water pump, ultrasonic level sensing, and shunt resistance for voltage sensing.
Arduino Nano
Water pump (relay controlled)
Water depth sensor (for tank water level)
Power source (solar panel & battery system)
